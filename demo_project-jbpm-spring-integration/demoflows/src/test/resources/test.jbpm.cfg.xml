<jbpm-configuration>

  <!--
    This configuration is used when there is no jbpm.cfg.xml file found in the
    root of the classpath.  It is a very basic configuration without persistence
    and message services.  Only the authorization service installed.
    You can parse and create processes, but when you try to use one of the
    unavailable services, you'll get an exception.
